My name is Geert Jansen. I'm a product guy at Red Hat where I work on the
[CloudForms][CF] product.

I live in the Boston, MA area with my wife and our two beautiful daughters.

This blog contains notes on random stuff that I'm working on. I'm not a
frequent blogger so the last post may be somewhat old. I'll try anyway.

Feel free to reach out to me via email.
